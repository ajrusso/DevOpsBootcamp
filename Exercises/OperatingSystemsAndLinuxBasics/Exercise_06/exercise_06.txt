EXERCISE 6: Bash Script - Start Node App
Write a bash script with following logic: 

Install NodeJS and NPM and print out which versions were installed
Download an artifact file from the URL: https://node-envvars-artifact.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/bootcamp-node-envvars-project-1.0.0.tgz. Hint: use curl or wget
Unzip the downloaded file
Set the following needed environment variables: APP_ENV=dev, DB_USER=myuser, DB_PWD=mysecret
Change into the unzipped package directory
Run the NodeJS application by executing the following commands:  npm install and node server.js
Notes:

Make sure to run the application in background so that it doesn't block the terminal session where you execute the shell script
If any of the variables is not set, the node app will print error message that env vars is not set and exit
It will give you a warning about LOG_DIR variable not set. You can ignore it for now.
